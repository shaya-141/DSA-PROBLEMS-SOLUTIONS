# 📌 Strings

This folder contains string-related Data Structures & Algorithms problems.
The focus is on understanding patterns, edge cases, and optimizing solutions
using techniques like frequency arrays, hashing, and two pointers.

---

## 🧠 Common Concepts Covered
- Character frequency
- Substrings & subsequences
- Palindrome logic
- Two pointers on strings
- Hashing with arrays / maps

---



---

## 🚀 Notes
- Strings look easy but hide tricky edge cases
- Always think about indexing, bounds, and empty strings
- Many string problems reduce to array / two-pointer patterns

---

📌 _More problems will be added as I progress in my DSA journey._
