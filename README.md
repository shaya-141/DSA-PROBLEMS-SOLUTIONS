# DSA Zero to Hero 🚀

This repository is my personal **Data Structures & Algorithms journey**, built with one goal:

**master problem-solving, not just solve problems.**

Every problem here is:
- solved after proper dry run and reasoning
- categorized by **pattern**
- written with **clean and readable code**
- meant to be **revised, taught, and reused**

## 🧩 What You'll Find

- Arrays & Strings  
- Two Pointers  
- Binary Search  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Graphs & Trees (coming soon)  
- Competitive Programming problems (Codeforces / CodeChef / LeetCode)

Each solution focuses on **why it works**, not just *what works*.
