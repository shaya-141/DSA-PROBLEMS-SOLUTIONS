# DSA PROBLEMS 🚀

This repository is my personal **Data Structures & Algorithms journey**, built with one goal:

**master problem-solving, not just solve problems.**

Every problem here is:
- solved after proper dry run and reasoning
- categorized by **pattern**
- written with **clean and readable code**
- meant to be **revised, taught, and reused**

---

## 🧩 What You'll Find

- Arrays & Strings  
- Two Pointers  
- Binary Search  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Graphs & Trees (coming soon)  
- Competitive Programming problems (Codeforces / CodeChef / LeetCode)

Each solution focuses on **why it works**, not just *what works*.

## ✍️ How I Solve Problems

1. Understand the problem deeply  
2. Dry run with pen & paper  
3. Identify the pattern  
4. Write optimal code  
5. Revisit and refactor if needed  

No copy-paste. No shortcuts.

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

- To build **strong fundamentals**
- To revise patterns quickly before contests/interviews
- To help others who want **clarity, not confusion**

---

## ⚡ Consistency Rule

> Even 1 problem a day beats 0.

## 📌 Note

This repo is continuously evolving as I grow.
